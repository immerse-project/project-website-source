IMMERSE is a research project which aims to prepare **numerical ocean models** for the next generation [Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service](http://marine.copernicus.eu/) (CMEMS). We intend to develop new capabilities in order to:

 - enable the production of ocean forecasts and analyses that exploit upcoming **high resolution satellite datasets**;
 - deliver ocean analyses and forecasts with the **higher spatial resolution** and additional **process complexity** demanded by users;
 - exploit the opportunities of new **high performance computing technology**;
 - allow **easy interfacing of CMEMS products** with detailed local coastal models.

These developments are delivered in the **[NEMO](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu) ocean model**, an established, world-class ocean modelling system that already forms the basis of the majority of the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service  analysis and forecast products.
