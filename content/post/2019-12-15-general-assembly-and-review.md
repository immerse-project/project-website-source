The project General Assembly was held in Paris on 12-13 Dec 2019. We decided to gather at the same location and time as the NEMO System Team for its annual merge party. The first two years of the IMMERSE project indeed mostly consist in developments to the NEMO ocean model and this is why we articulate our agenda and activities with the NEMO consortium. The meeting consisted in a combination of talks reviewing the project progress and more in depth scientific presentations. See you all next year !
