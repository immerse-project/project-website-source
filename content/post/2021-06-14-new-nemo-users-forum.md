The need for setting up a new forum for NEMO users to share experience and tips was raised during on of the splinter session of our general assembly in March 2021. In response to this need the NEMO system team opened a new forum on *discourse* a week ago. Open 7 days ago the forum has already 57 registered users !  Thanks to the NEMO system team for its reactivity ! We are looking forward to share our experience with NEMO with you all on this new plateform !
