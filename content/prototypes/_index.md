We are preparing 3 prototype model configurations which prefigure the next generation NEMO-based CMEMS systems.

 - **IBI-1km** : The IMMERSE IBI-1Km prototype prepares the next generation CMEMS IBI-MFC model forecast system, which will resolve ocean currents at kilometric scale.
 - **ORCA36**  : The ORCA36 prototype is a 1/36Â° resolution global ocean model able to simulate explicitely mesoscale ocean dynamics in most of the global ocean.
 - **ORCA12-AGRIF** : The ORCA12-AGRIF prototype uses a regional mesh refinement strategy for captuing the dynamics of dense water overflows.
